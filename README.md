This study investigates non-textual visualization of metadata in VR to help users understand 3D objects, focusing on cultural heritage. Using a research-through-design approach, we gathered data from museum visitor interviews to identify key visualization characteristics. A prototype VR experience was developed, presenting object information across three visual layers. After testing with participants, we suggest that VR metadata visualization is effective when it gives layered information in a narrative sequence with multisensory cues. We offer more research to explore further and evaluate these visualization techniques.
